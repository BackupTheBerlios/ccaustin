The following step-by-step guide details how to prepare your computer for 
building the site on your machine.

Prerequites:

1. Ant 1.4
2. JDK 1.3.1
3. XalanJ 2.2D9 (jar placed in $ANT_HOME/lib)

Installation instructions:


1. Install appropriate software and dependencies:

Java : 
     a. http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download-windows.html
     b. Install using standard installation program to any location

Cygwin (Unix tools for Windows - not needed for Unix systems) :
     a. http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/
     b. Install using the internet installer. It will download and
     install all appropriate things. I use c:\cygwin as the
     installation location.

2. Define the following environment variables:

CALVARY_HOME=<project root> (i.e. c:\Projects\calvary)
JAVA_HOME=<jdk installation root> (i.e. c:\jdk1.3.1)
PATH=$CALVARY_HOME/bin:JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

(May need to reboot or close/restart any shell prompts

3. To build:

   a. start Cygwin or any bash shell
   b. cd %CALVARY_HOME% (e.g. cd /c/Projects/ccaustin)
   c. ./ant

   If your path is setup correctly, the ant shell script will load the
   build.xml file from CALVARY_HOME and run the appropriate targets for building all web
   pages (and eventually Java source code)

   All build pages are located in CALVARY_HOME/build

4. Understanding the directory layout:

   CALVARY_HOME
	BUILD - where HTML, images, javascript, and Java source code
	        goes after being processed by Ant build script
	DOCS - various documentation used by the project team. Not for
	       the public web site!
	PROTOTYPES - screenshots, other things important during
	development work. 
	SRC - the sourcecode for the project
	    WEB - the web site files (images, XML, XSLT, CSS, etc.)
	    JAVA - future location of Java source code for web site or
	    	   build process extensions.

5. View the developer's guide: 

   CALVARY_HOME/src/dev/index.html
