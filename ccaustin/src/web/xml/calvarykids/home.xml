  <p>Calvary Kids' mission is to reach children and parents, both 
  here at Calvary Chapel Austin and out in the world beyond, with 
  the love of God, through the teaching of His Word and through 
  service to them.</p>
  <p>Our mission can be summed up by the acronym K.I.D.S.:</p>
  <p><strong>K</strong>now our Families!<br/>
  <strong>I</strong>ntroduce them to Christ!<br/>
  <strong>D</strong>isciple, Disciple, Disciple!<br/>
  <strong>S</strong>end them out to Serve!</p>
  <p class="subheading">Overview</p>
  <p>Calvary Kids is designed to serve children from ages one month 
  through 5th grade. We have three departments in our Children's 
  Ministry: Nursery (newborn through 2 years old), Preschool (3 
  - 5 years old), and Elementary (1st - 5th grade). We love children 
  and open our classes to serve them on all service times. Our 
  Sunday class activities includes Bible lessons, worship, crafts, 
  play, felt stories, games and lots of heart felt care from trained 
  teachers and assistants.</p>
  <p>On Wednesday evening we have a separate curriculum servicing 
  our Toddler and Preschool Ministries. Our YDC Club meets on 
  Wednesday evening as well, and trains our children in a real 
  fun, active way to live for Christ. They win prizes and earn 
  awards as they learn important Christian values and Biblical 
  truths.<br/></p>
