	  <overview>The FOCUS (Fellowship of Christians United in Service) singles group consists of men and women who are beyond the college years.</overview>
	  <long-description>
	    <p>The primary reason we meet together is to focus our attention on the Lord in praise, prayer, bible study, service, and fellowship. We build bonds of concern and friendship amongst one another.</p>
         <p>We meet at the church on Saturday nights at 7:00 pm for study, either topical or bible, prayer and fellowship (check out the calendar for details). We are involved in various ministries within the church as well as outside. We also have a monthly social activity.</p>
