	  <overview>The men's accountability group meets to provide men a place to form relationships while being discipled through teaching, accountability and prayer.</overview>
	  <long-description>
	    <p>The men's accountability group meets every Tuesday morning at 6am at Coffee Creator. We have a devotion with emphasis on application, then discuss whatever is going on in our lives. We close by sharing prayer requests and praying for each other. Relationships are formed, so if someone is struggling in a particular area that person can either bring the issue before the group or get together with one or two other men for counseling or discipleship. </p>
