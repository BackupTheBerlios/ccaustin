	    <p>The men's accountability group meets every Tuesday morning at 6am at Seattle's Best Coffee at Parmer and IH35. We have a devotion with emphasis on application, then discuss whatever is going on in our lives. We close by sharing prayer requests and praying for each other. Relationships are formed, so if someone is struggling in a particular area that person can either bring the issue before the group or get together with one or two other men for counseling or discipleship. </p>
