	  <long-description>
	    <p>Lifeline is the College and Career group at Calvary Chapel of Austin.  We meet for a Bible study &amp; fellowship every Friday night on UT campus in room 21 of the Flawn Academic Center (FAC).  We have live, modern worship and time for connecting with other Christians.  Lifeline is the perfect way for young singles and couples (18-35) to learn, grow, and serve.</p>

		<heading>Specialized Groups</heading>
		<p>We have several groups available to meet the needs of our LifeLine members and guests:</p>
  		  <subheading>Living Life</subheading>
		  <p>“Living life” is the name of our accountability groups.  We meet for Sunday lunch to discuss the sermon as a point of prayer and application.</p>
  		  <subheading>Learning Life</subheading>
		  <p>“Learning Life” is the name of our discipleship teams.  Titus 2 gives us an example for church discipleship, which we offer to each person in LifeLine.</p>
  		  <subheading>Loving Life</subheading>
		  <p>“Loving Life” is the name of our outreach teams.  As scheduled we hit the streets of UT campus, and sometimes beyond, to share the love of Christ with a lost world.</p>
