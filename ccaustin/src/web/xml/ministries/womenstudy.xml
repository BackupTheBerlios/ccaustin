	    <p>Both morning and evening studies start  Tuesday, Sep 17.  The morning study will meet every week from 10-11:30AM and child care will be provided.  The evening study will meet every other week from 7-9PM but with no childcare.  Please sign up at the Events Center.</p>
	    <heading>Morning Bible Study</heading>
		<p>During the fall and spring, Women at Calvary offers a morning Bible Study.  Studies usually include a time of worship, book overviews, study questions and prayer time.  Babysitting as well as homeschooling classes are available on a cooperative basis, with anyone bringing children taking turns providing childcare.  We have studied books by Nancy Missler, Jill Briscoe, Kay Arthur, Elizabeth George and Beth Moore.  Last Spring, we did a study of the Proverbs, by Sandy MacIntosh. Currently we are studying the book of Colossians. We meet for fellowship from 9:30 to 10:00 and the Bible study begins at 10:00 and is over at 11:30.</p>

	    <heading>Evening Bible Study</heading>
		<p>Look for an evening study to begin soon. The evening study meets every other Tuesday night from 7:00-9:00 PM in the main auditorium.  Childcare is not provided.</p>
