    <overview>The Worship Team is the group of singers and musicians that lead the worship services.  Team members are selected by audition only and must exhibit spiritual maturity and be a regular part of the fellowship.</overview>
    <long-description>
      <p>We at Calvary Chapel believe that the worship of God should be inspirational.  Therefore, we give great place for music. Music is one of the different formats by which man can express feelings, desires, hope, peace, joy and love toward God.</p>
      
      <p>All of our services begin with a time of worship through music.  Music is a gift of expression given to man by God, therefore, we use contemporary music in our worship services.  It is an opportunity for believers to render themselves to the Lord by giving thanks and praise, as well as offering our confession, repentance and devotion to Him.  It is truly a time where we give to the Lord our worship.</p>
      
      <p>A song is a vehicle to convey the thoughts and feelings of the heart.  The songs we sing are well grounded in the Word of God and are sung as praise (songs about God and His attributes), worship (songs that are directed towards God) and exhortation from God (God speaking the body of believers, as is found so often in scripture).</p>

      <subheading>Calvary Austin Music Website</subheading>
      <p>Recently, with the release of the Calvary Austin Worship team's "I Will" CD, they also launced the <link href="http://www.calvaryaustinmusic.org/">Calvary Austin Music</link> web site. Be sure to go there and check out some of the sample songs from the album and to find out how to get your own copy. There are also some video clips and updates about where some of the songs have been playing across the country on the radio.</p>
