                <name>Free Indeed (Addictions) Ministry</name> 
                <overview>Our purpose: The puprose of Calvary Free Indeed is to honor and glorify God through our outreach to the church and community. We want to provide hope and freedom to those that are struggling with habitual sin (substance abuse, pornography, overeating, smoking, sexual impurity) and give them an understanding of the foundational truths that God has given us that are the means to being free from addictions.</overview>

                        <p><strong>"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." -- John 8:36</strong></p> 
						<p><strong>Our Vision: The vision is to use the gospel of Jesus Christ in teaching those that are struggling with habitual sin about the freedom found in Jesus Christ. We use our resources to reach as many as possible to share, in grace, the foundational truth found in God's Word apart from those methods used by worldly wisdom or methodologies.</strong></p>
						<p>First and foremost, we must tell you that God's grace is able to help you overcome any sin, and there is hope for you. Calvary Austin's Free Indeed ministry is based on the <link href="http://www.settingcaptivesfree.com/home/">Setting Captives Free</link> ministry that was started by Mike Cleveland and we use their web based curriculum to aid us in Free Indeed. This program offers web based courses that will help you to understand the addiction or habitual sin nature of man. The courses allow you to see why habitual sin is wrong and the steps necessary to live a life that glorifies God. This program provides an excellent foundation for us to teach and equip you to be able to claim that you are "Free Indeed." The Free Indeed program at Calvary is based on people who have experienced these problems themselves and understand your fear, shame, lonliness, and struggles.</p>
						<p>It is our desire to provide a mentor, if possible, for the specific program you would like to take. If one is available, we can assign a mentor from Calvary Austin. If one is not currently available from Calvary Austin, one will be assigned for you by Setting Captives Free. Once you have enrolled and been assigned a mentor for the course, we can assign an accountability partner at Calvary Austin. The difference is that a mentor has been trained to take you through the course, whereas the accountability partner will be somebody from our chruch that will read your course responses and pray for you. It is our desire to see you "Free Indeed" and gain the life and fulfillment that God wants us to have in our relationship with him. Please do not start a Setting Captives Free online course before you contact us if you wish to have a mentor or accountability partner from Calvary Austin.</p>
