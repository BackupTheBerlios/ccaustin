	<p><strong>Establishing Effective Discipline for Your Children</strong>: Friday @ 7:30pm - West Central<br></br>
Most people receive little training in how to fulfill one of the most important responsibilities of our lives--being effective parents. We burst with pride and joy at birth, but are often unsure as to how to raise that child to become a mature, responsible adult. Discipline is a biblically mandated responsibility as we train our children. Learn what to look for as your child goes through each developmental stage, and how to discipline well in each stage.<br></br> 
Chapter topics include:<br></br>
* Purposeful Discipline <br></br>
* Response-abilities<br></br> 
* Boundaries<br></br> 
* Consequences<br></br> 
* Spanking<br></br> 
* Building Your Endurance </p>

<p><strong>Helping Your Children Know God</strong>: Friday @ 7:30pm - Cedar Park<br></br>
This study was written so that moms and dads will grow in their own understanding of our great God, and will be challenged and equipped to pass that understanding on to a new generation.<br></br>

<p><strong>Raising Children of Faith</strong>: Friday @ 7:30pm - North - Wells Branch<br></br>
As Christian parents, we want our children to enjoy a strong, satisfying, life-transforming faith. But beyond modeling a strong faith, many of us still wonder, "What specific things can we do to be even more purposeful in growing our kids' faith?" Gain confidence and a clear plan in this small group study.<br></br>
Together with other couples, you and your spouse will learn how to:<br></br> 
* Develop an even stronger, more loving relationship with your kids<br></br> 
* Lovingly lead your children to God and help them walk with God<br></br> 
* Raise children with an awareness that they have a God-ordained mission in life.</p>
