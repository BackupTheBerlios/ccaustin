      <p>Calvary Chapel offers couples the opportunity to take
	part in various meetings designed to build and strengthen
	marriages.  These meetings are held in a home setting to
	provide a casual, intimate, and non-threatening environment to
	all who wish to participate. Currently, we are offering a
	series of the HomeBuilders curriculum.  These series range
	from 4 to 8 weeks and are designed to help you build a godly
	marriage and develop relationships with other couples through
	the application of Biblical principles. Registration for Fall,
	Winter, and Spring meetings will be announced prior to the
	start of the session.    </p>
