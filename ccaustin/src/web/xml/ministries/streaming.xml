	  <overview>The Streaming Media Ministry provides access to both live and archived services in
	    Real Audio and Real Video format. </overview>
	  <long-description>
	    <p>Currently we Live Stream our 3rd service on Sunday
	    11:30 a.m., our mid-week service on Wednesday 7:00 p.m., and our College and Career
	    service on Friday 7:30 p.m. The Real Audio archives are constantly being updated to
	    provide access to all of the past messages. The Real Video messages for the past two
	    services are also available. The Streaming Media Ministry also provides a closed circuit
	    feed to the New Parents room enabling New Parents to attend services and to their
	    children. So whether you are unable to make it to service or you just want to
	    review, log on and be blessed.</p>
