	    <heading>Prayer</heading>
	    <p>The Men's Ministry is about prayer. We call the men to pray for the church. Each Friday morning (6:00 AM) we invite the men to come pray in the New Parent's room. Enter through the church front door.</p>
	    <heading>Study</heading>
	    <p>The Men's Ministry is about God's word. We desire to see men moved through the power of God's word. This Bible study meets every other Tuesday night (7:00 PM) in the Youth Room. Check the <link href="../calendar/calendar.html">calendar</link> for upcoming meetings.</p>
         <p>Our current study will cover Men of Faith from the New Testament. You are welcome to join at any time, as we only study a chapter each meeting.</p>
	    <heading>Accountability</heading>
	    <p>The Men's Ministry is about growing together. As iron sharpens iron. <br/>
