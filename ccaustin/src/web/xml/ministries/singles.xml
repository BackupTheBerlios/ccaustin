      <p>Calvary Singles consists of men and women of all ages. The primary reason we meet together is to focus our attention on the Lord in praise, prayer, Bible study, service, and fellowship. We build bonds of concern and friendship amongst one another. We meet at the church on Saturday nights at 6:30pm for study of the Bible, prayer, and fellowship (check out the <link href="../calendar/schedule.html">weekly schedule</link> for details). We are involved in various ministries within the church as well as outside. We also have monthly social activies.</p>
