    <long-description>
      <p>During our Saturday night meetings, we have Bible Studies and Prayer time.  (Both requests and praise)  After the structured meeting, we stay and fellowship, confide, stretch our minds, discover new ministry opportunities and mentor each other.  We are undergoing some focus adjustments, since there has been a change in leadership and we presently have temporary leaders.  We are prayerfully waiting on the Lord to send us the person He has chosen for this position.</p>
