      <p> Prayer. Sounds old school. With all the leadership resources available today, do we really need to be reminded to pray? It's precisely because we have so many leadership resources that we need to be reminded. Paul was arguably the greatest Christian leader of all time and, by one man's count, the New Testament contains as many as 35 of his prayers! In this conference, we will take a new look at eight of them and rediscover the need for praying leaders.</p>
