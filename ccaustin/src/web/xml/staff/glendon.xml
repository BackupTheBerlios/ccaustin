<heading>Spouse</heading>
<p>Carol</p>

<heading>Children</heading>
<p>Katie and Lauren</p>

<heading>Very Brief Testimony</heading>
<p>I grew up in a Christian home with the most influence toward God coming from the example set by my mom and her Godly parents. Their examples set, and prayers for me, had much to do with me receiving Christ as a young teenager. It wasn't until about 1998 that I began to commit my life to the Lord with a level of desire that would eventually lead me to serving in full time ministry in 1996.</p>

<heading>Favorite Book of the Bible and Why</heading>
<p>Romans because it constantly reminds me of God's love for me and the great sacrifice He made in sending Jesus for me. It was also my Grandpa's favorite book.</p>

<heading>Favorite Verse and Why</heading>
<p>Romans 12:1-2. Constant reminder that I am to be conformed to the likeness of our Lord.</p>

<heading>Favorite Book (besides the Bible) and Why</heading>
<p>"Why Grace Changes Everything" by Chuck Smith. Only as I grow to understand grace do I have hope of conforming to the likeness of Christ.</p>

<heading>Who do you most admire (besides Jesus)</heading>
<p>My Grandpa and Grandma. They were serious about the Lord.</p>

<heading>What do you do at Calvary</heading>
<p>Pastoral ministries and Facilities.</p>
