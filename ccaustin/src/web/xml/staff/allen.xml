	<text>
		<p>Allen grew up attending church and Christian school but without having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. In 1979, at age fourteen, he received Christ and immediately began to study and to teach the Bible. Allen graduated with honors from Pacific High School in San Bernardino, CA in 1983. He then began what would become an eight-year internship at Calvary Chapel of San Bernardino.</p>
		<p>In 1986 and 1987 Allen was part of a music ministry. He had the opportunity to share Christ through music in many venues in four different counties in Southern California. Allen was married to Andrea in 1989 and accepted the position of Assistant Pastor at <a href="http://www.calvarychapel.org/redbarn">Calvary Chapel of San Bernardino.</a>
		</p>
		<p>Allen moved with Andrea to Austin in 1991 and, at age 26, planted Calvary Chapel of Austin. In just eight years the church has grown from eight adults and children to nearly 1,000. Allen's contemporary style is popular with audiences of all ages. He is heard twice daily throughout the Austin area on the "Calvary Continuum" radio broadcast and has traveled and ministered in Australia, Austria, China, Hungary, Israel, and Serbia. </p>
		<p>Allen lives in Austin with his wife and daughter. </p>
