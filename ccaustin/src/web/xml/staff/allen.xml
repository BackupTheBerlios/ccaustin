<heading>Very Brief Testimony</heading>
<p>I grew up going to church and believing all the right things. While on summer vacation between eighth and ninth grade, I spent a lot of time reading the Bible and came to understand the difference between being religious and having a relationship with God. I made a commitment to Christ and knew in my heart that God's plan for my life was to plant and pastor a Calvary Chapel someday.</p>

<heading>Favorite Book of the Bible and Why</heading>
<p>Ephesians was an early favorite. It captures the essence of the Christian life.</p>

<heading>Favorite Verse and Why</heading>
<p>Ephesians 2:8-9. One word: grace.</p>

<heading>Favorite Book (besides the Bible) and Why</heading>
<p>I have read "Walking with the Giants" by Warren Wiersbe over and over again. It inspires me to give God my best.</p>

<heading>Who do you most admire (besides Jesus)</heading>
<p>My wife, Andrea, for the way she handles the impossible role of "pastor's wife".</p>

<heading>What do you do at Calvary</heading>
<p>My God-given role is two-fold: teacher and vision-caster (i.e. I communicate and lead).</p>
