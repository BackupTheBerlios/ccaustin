<heading>Children</heading>

<heading>Very Brief Testimony</heading>
<p>I came to Christ in 1988 when I was in college at Southwest Texas State in San Marcos. I was invited to a Mylon LeFevre concert and after his band played about 45 minutes, he started to preach. It seemed like he preached for about an hour but everything he said was like God speaking directly to me. About 5 days later I surrendered my life to Jesus.</p>

<heading>Favorite Book of the Bible and Why</heading>
<p>Hebrews. It's an overview of both the Old and New Testament all in one letter.</p>

<heading>Favorite Verse and Why</heading>
<p>Matthew 22:37 "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all you soul and with all your mind." It's the greatest commandment.</p>

<heading>Favorite Book (besides the Bible) and Why</heading>
<p>"Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis. (I heard it was a really good book:-). No, really, it's a great author writing about the greatest story. I read it every couple of years and am still impaced by it.</p>

<heading>Who do you most admire (besides Jesus)</heading>
<p>My wife. It's amazing to see what the Lord has done in her life and the way that she gives Him the glory.</p>

<heading>What do you do at Calvary</heading>
<p>I am the Worship Pastor (I sit in my office and play the guitar) and the Financial Adminstrator.</p>
