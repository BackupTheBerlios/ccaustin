<content title="Our History">
	<text>
		<p>In 1991, Allen and Andrea Rigg moved to Austin from San Bernardino, CA, where Allen had served as an assistant pastor. Only 26 years old, they planted Calvary Austin. The first Thursday evening Bible study was held in the clubhouse at the Polo Club Apartments in NW Austin. Early in 1992, the Bible study moved to what was then the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel in North Austin. </p>
		<p>The small group continued to grow and after meeting on Easter Sunday, it was decided to begin regular Sunday morning services on June 7, 1992. That fall the new church moved to the DoubleTree Hotel. The still-growing group was on the move again in the summer of 1993 as the church began leasing the facility of Austin First Seventh Day Adventist Church. The Adventists were meeting on Saturday and Wednesday and Calvary Austin on Sunday and Thursday. </p>
		<p>The church continued to grow and in the spring of 1995 went to two Sunday morning services. On June 7, 1998, Calvary Austin moved to its present location in the Quail Creek Shopping Center in North Austin. The church, which began with eight adults and children eight years ago, has grown to about 1,000. The church continues to grow and in February 2000 went to two Sunday morning services. Calvary Austin looks to purchase land and build a campus that will serve as a permanent home. </p>
