<h3>HTML Pages</h3>
<p>The HTML pages are built by the combination of the XML content and the XSL 
  templates. They may be built locally for verification of a modified page or 
  in staging for review and publishing. Aside from the documents you are reading 
  now, all HTML pages are generated, and thus never actually stored in CVS for 
  later use. Our HTML pages take advantage of Javascript and Cascading Style Sheets 
  (CSS) to produce the final page. </p>
