<h3>XML Document</h3>
<p>An XML document is a text file that contains data, marked up by a beginning 
  and ending tag set. Generally, an XML document should be thought of as content, 
  or data, which is different from HTML pages which contain both content and layout 
  (how it should look). An XML document can be edited using any sort of standard 
  text editor, such as Wordpad that comes with Windows, or a full text editor 
  like Emacs. It should never be edited with something like Microsoft Office, 
  as it will ruin the content. </p>
<p>An XML document is considered well-formed if all of its tags are properly opened 
  and closed and it has the appropriate XML declaration heading in it. If a document 
  is not well-formed, it cannot be processed and therefore cannot be published. 
  The following is an example of a well-formed XML document:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;content title=&quot;About Us&quot;&gt;<br>	&lt;heading&gt;10th Anniversary in Austin&lt;/heading&gt;<br>	&lt;p&gt;Sunday, June 2 will mark two milestones
	  for Calvary Chapel of Austin: 10 years of 
      meeting as a fellowship, and 4 years in 
      our current building. 
    &lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/content&gt;</pre>
<p>The following is <b>not</b> a well-formed document (notice the end tags &lt;/p&gt; 
  and &lt;/content&gt; are missing:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;content title=&quot;About Us&quot;&gt;<br>	&lt;heading&gt;10th Anniversary in Austin&lt;/heading&gt;<br>	&lt;p&gt;Sunday</pre>
