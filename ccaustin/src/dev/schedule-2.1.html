<h3>Calvary Web v2.1 Schedule</h3>
<p>Version 2.1 is more of a loose list of items that need to be addressed due 
  to limited time for the release of v2.0. It will also attempt to address the 
  need to allow others to edit the content of existing web pages by offering a 
  cruide web page in place of the complex setup of our various technology needs 
  for development. Future versions will likely contain more strategic direction.</p>
<p><b>Numbered prefixes</b> correspond to task items in the Berlios task manager 
  that contain more detail. Login to <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/account/login.php">Berlios</a> 
  and visit the <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/pm/task.php?group_id=265&group_project_id=104&func=browse&set=open">task 
  list</a> to learn more about each task. <b>Note for Mac users</b>: You will 
  need to open the Berlios site using Netscape, as they do not support Mac/Internet 
  Explorer yet. </p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Currenly, the date range is not correct. Based on current estimates, 
  this iteration will end on October 4th, although much of the work will be rolled 
  out gradually due to its nature for basic content update (versus large-scale 
  updates that will require strategic rollout plans).</p>
