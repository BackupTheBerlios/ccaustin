<h3>Calvary Web v2.1 Schedule</h3>
<p>Version 2.1 is more of a loose list of items that need to be addressed due 
  to limited time for the release of v2.0. It will also attempt to address the 
  need to allow others to edit the content of existing web pages by offering a 
  cruide web page in place of the complex setup of our various technology needs 
  for development. Future versions will likely contain more strategic direction.</p>
<p><b>Numbered prefixes</b> correspond to task items in the Berlios task manager 
  that contain more detail. Login to <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/account/login.php">Berlios</a> 
  and visit the <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/pm/task.php?group_id=265&group_project_id=104&func=browse&set=open">task 
  list</a> to learn more about each task. <b>Note for Mac users</b>: You will 
  need to open the Berlios site using Netscape, as they do not support Mac/Internet 
  Explorer yet. </p>
<p><b>Note</b>: The assigned dates are not firm, and thus the tasks may occur 
  in the order best determined by the individual. Tasks may also be picked up 
  by another. This schedule is for a worst case scenario, and allows room for 
  error and unforseen circumstances given the part-time nature of the ministry.</p>
