<h3>Staging Process</h3>
<p>The staging process allows changes made and commited to the CVS source control 
  server for publishing to be built for others to see. We offer the staging process 
  on an hourly basis, at the top of the hour. Therefore, by :05 after the hour 
  (approx), your changes that were commited to CVS will be seen for review. You 
  may use this to verify your changes (all files were added/updated to CVS, etc) 
  and also to send an email to someone that requested a fix, so they may see the 
  changes and review the verbage for event descriptions, etc. </p>
<p>In the future, we will enable content editors to review changes and mark them 
  as publishable, thereby reducing mistakes that tend to be more common from automatic 
  publishing (and when you have more content generators than actual web dev staff 
  - all your ministry leaders, etc.).</p>
