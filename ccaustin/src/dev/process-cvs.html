<h3>CVS Server</h3>
<p>The CVS server enables all files associated with the web site to be stored 
  at a central location, and versioned. This versioning allows changes to be made 
  by multiple people, even simultaneously, without others losing their changes. 
  In addition, it allows mistakes to be corrected by ensuring that older, working 
  versions of files are available should something accidental occur to a file. 
  All images, XML, XSL, CSS, Javascript, and ant script files are stored in our 
  CVS server. </p>
