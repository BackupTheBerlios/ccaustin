<h3>Sitemap</h3>
<p>The sitemap is an <a href="process-xml.html">XML file</a> that defines all 
  of the web site sections, including individual pages with the site. It is used 
  to construct the following items:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="process-ant.html">Ant build script </a>- this allows the dedundant, 
    error-prone work of keeping the ant script up to date with the current set 
    of site pages to be removed. Our ant script, when the web target is invoked, 
    will generate a new ant script using the sitemap and a custom XSL template. 
    Thus, we actually use our build system to build our build system. Cool, eh?</li>
  <li>Menus - The dynamic Javascript menus at the top menu bar of every page are 
    generated automatically. This removes problems where a page may be added to 
    the site but missing from the menu</li>
  <li>Ministry list - The ministry home page contains a master list of ministries 
    known to the site. We use the sitemap to produce this list.</li>
</ul>
<p>A page entry in the sitemap can be marked as excluded, which means it should 
  not be used to generate menus or master lists (like the ministry page). They 
  may also be marked hidden, which means that are not used for menus, master lists, 
  or even the master sitemap page that shows the user an index of all pages in 
  the site for finding that one ellusive page they know they saw once before (future).</p>
