<h2>Technology Overview </h2>
<p>The Calvary Web Site is composed of the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Static web pages - what you see when you visit (<a href="http://www.calvarychapel.org/austin">http://www.calvarychapel.org/austin</a>)</li>
  <li>Local server - the server that handles email and the redirection from <a href="http://www.calvaryaustin.org">http://www.calvaryaustin.org</a> 
    to <a href="http://www.calvarychapel.org/austin">http://www.calvarychapel.org/austin</a></li>
  <li>RealVideo feed - live RealVideo recorded at Calvary Austin and sent to Calvary 
    Chapel Costa Mesa where it is multicast to all currently viewing browsers.</li>
  <li>RealAudio feed - archived broadcasts and special events stored in Costa 
    Mesa</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that Calvary Austin does not host the equipment to broadcast ReadAudio 
  and RealVideo to all users. CCCA encodes the signal in either real time or offline 
  and transmits the data to CCCM, where it is available to anyone who wishes to 
  view/listen.</p>
<h3>Static Web Pages</h3>
<p>Version 1 of the web site used standard HTML coded by hand or using HTML tools. 
  Several problems were identified:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Anyone who wanted to modify the content of a page must know HTML</li>
  <li>Ministry leaders cannot update their own pages without first having the 
    change reviewed (if they were even familiar with HTML) to prevent incorrect 
    or inconsistent style</li>
  <li>Transitioning to a more dynamic web site would prove more cumbersome since 
    content and layout (text and HTML tags) were mixed in the same format</li>
  <li>The web site look and feel is still functional but 2 years old - to change 
    the look and color set would require large amounts of labor</li>
</ol>
<p>Version 2 is targeted with the following ideas in mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some of the web pages will be dynamic and provide searchable content (tape 
    catalog, audio archives, discussion areas, etc.)</li>
  <li>The web site should be able to change looks based on the ministry section, 
    season of the year, etc.</li>
  <li>It should start as static pages, including content from the existing site 
    plus new ministry content, and eventually take on more dynamic capabilities 
    as needed</li>
  <li>Provide a cleaner separation of content and HTML to enable quick UI changes 
    and easier migration to dynamic generation</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the following technologies were chosen for v2.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li>XML for content management - simple flat files that contain marked up content 
    that may eventually be moved to a database for dynamic web page generation.</li>
  <li>XSLT for the transformation of XML into HTML using a template-based approach</li>
  <li>Initially, all HTML will be generated from XML + XSL on a Calvary Austin 
    server, previewed, then transmitted (FTP) to the Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa 
    static web servers</li>
</ul>
<p>Future versions (2.1+) will utilize the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java servlets and Java server pages for dynamic content</li>
  <li>PHP + mySQL for intranet pages, since berlios (our free hosting)
  has this already. Netcraft stats: The site ccaustin.berlios.de is running Apache/1.3.19 (Unix) (SuSE/Linux) mod_ssl/2.8.3 OpenSSL/0.9.6a PHP/4.0.6 PHP/3.0.18 mod_throttle/3.0 mod_layout/1.0 mod_fastcgi/2.2.2 mod_dtcl on Linux.</li>
  <li>A server-side database</li>
  <li>One or more dynamic servers using Tomcat and MySql, or something similiar 
    (on Linux)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Local Server</h3>
<p>TBD</p>
<h3>Multimedia (Video/Audio)</h3>
