<h2>Developing Pages</h2>
<p>This page provides an overview of the process, components, and roles of the 
  Calvary 2.0 Web site for understanding how everything fits together to compose 
  the static web pages. It also provides a simple step-by-step guide for building 
  your first few XML/XSL pages after you have successfully installed and processed 
  existing pages into HTML.</p>
<h3>Process Overview</h3>
<p>The following diagram shows the roles (blue), the primary components (white) 
  and the locations where the components live (brown/green):</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Components</h4>
<h5>XML Document</h5>
<p>Contains the data for one or more targeted HTML pages. Data is usually in the 
  format:</p>
<table width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td> 
      <pre class="codecell">&lt;content title=&quot;Our Vision&quot;&gt;<br>	&lt;visionstatement&gt;<br>		&lt;purpose&gt;To win lost people to Christ,
       to equip them for ministry, and to send 
       them to serve. 
       &lt;/purpose&gt;
       &lt;vision&gt;<br>			&lt;item id=&quot;1&quot; goal=&quot;Win a person to Christ&quot;
            goalLogo=&quot;../images/win.gif&quot; 
            goalImg=&quot;../images/winttl.gif&quot;
            according=&quot;Mark 16:15&quot; 
            quote=&quot;and He said to them,...&quot;/&gt;<br>       &lt;/vision&gt;
   &lt;/visionstatement&gt;</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h5>XSL Document</h5>
<p>An XSL Document uses an XML format and special tags to tell an XSL processor 
  how to convert XML to any format. For the web site, we use HTML so the XSL file 
  will contain HTML templates with XSL code that manipulates an XML document's 
  contents and merges them into the resulting HTML. XSL has a very simple format 
  and is easy to learn. XSL usually is in the format:</p>
<table width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre class="codecell">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br>    <br>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; 
 xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;<br>
 &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;
  doctype-system=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;
  doctype-public=&quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;xsl:include href=&quot;../general-ui.xsl&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;xsl:include href=&quot;../general-html.xsl&quot;/&gt;
 
 &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;visionstatement&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;purpose&quot;/&gt;<br>   &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;vision&quot;/&gt;<br>     &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;text&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br> &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;<br>
      </pre>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h5>Ant Script</h5>
<p>Ant is a pure Java version of Make and uses XML to define the steps necessary 
  to compile code, process XML and XSL, and perform other tasks like creating, 
  removing, and renaming files and folders. It in essence provides a simple way 
  to manage project work without writing a lot of hard to read scripting. The 
  script is used by Calvary Web to perform XSL transformation by identifying the 
  XML, XSL and resulting HTML output names and it will do the appropriate work 
  using the Apache Xalan XSL processor.</p>
<h5>HTML</h5>
<p>The HTML is a result of the XSL + XML processed through the Ant script.</p>
<h4>Roles</h4>
<p>The following roles are required for the Calvary Web site to be created and 
  published: </p>
<h5>Content Writer</h5>
The content writer is responsible for working with ministry leaders to obtain 
the appropriate ministry information, page requirements, and content. This is 
then used to construct XML documents with the data, and work with the HTML writer 
to determine the best method of page structure and layout. The content writer 
need only to know how to use the most basic of text editors (notepad or similiar) 
to do their job, and must be willing to interact with a number of ministries and 
stay abreast of changes in ministry events and update the content appropriately. 
<h5>HTML Writer</h5>
<p>The HTML writer role requires basic knowledge of HTML and possibly Javascript. 
  They should have a flare for web design and be able to work with content writers 
  on the appropriate page structure and layout. They may utilize others familiar 
  with web graphics design, or if possible, construct the web graphics themselves. 
  The HTML writer works with the XSL writer to help transition the design of web 
  pages into the appropriate format as the XSL is constructed (no XSL expertise 
  is required).</p>
<h5>XSL Writer</h5>
<p>The XSL writer role requires a bit more of a scripting or programming background, 
  as they must be able to use XML and HTML sources to properly construct an XSL 
  document. Control flow, such as loops, tests, and text/data maniplation is common 
  in XSL to properly process an XML document and create HTML. HTML background 
  is nice but not a must, since buggy XSL templates could render bad HTML and 
  cause problems that must be debugged.</p>
<h5>User with Browser</h5>
<p>The user and browser is the target audience and overall recipient of the hard 
  work. Prior to a user being able to view a page, the page should be reviewed 
  by one or more ministry staff and then published from the local Calvary Austin 
  network to the Costa Mesa servers.</p>
<h3>How XML Becomes HTML</h3>
<p>(With apologies to School House Rock)</p>
<p>TBD...</p>
<h3>Getting Started: Step-By-Step</h3>
<p>1. Choose a layout</p>
<p>There are currently 3 layouts to choose from:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr align="center" valign="top"> 
    <td> 
      <p><img src="images/layout-std.gif" width="111" height="99"></p>
      <p>Standard</p>
    </td>
    <td> 
      <p><img src="images/layout-sb-left.gif" width="111" height="99"></p>
      <p>Left Sidebar</p>
    </td>
    <td> 
      <p><img src="images/layout-sb-right.gif" width="111" height="99"></p>
      <p>Right Sidebar</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Generally, the standard layout is chosen, but the left or right sidebar enable 
  an image to be placed in a sidebar next to the content (photos of people, topics, 
  etc.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create XML document</p>
<p>TBD - content outer tag, optional inner tags, HTML tags using existing code 
  as an example</p>
<table width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre class="codecell">TBD - XML template <br>
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Create XSL document</p>
<p>TBD - appropriate includes for layout type, strategies, predefined templates, 
  processing order using existing code as an example</p>
<table width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre class="codecell">TBD - XSL template and includes for layout<br>
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Add to Ant Script</p>
<p>TBD - copy and paste existing line, talk about 3 arguments in script, consider 
  future and better methods for removing this step</p>
<table width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre class="codecell">TBD - Ant script entry example<br>
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Run Ant</p>
<p>Start a shell (Cygwin on NT), change to CALVARY_HOME and run:</p>
<table width="70%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre class="codecell">prompt&gt; ant<br>
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Refer to the installation instructions for proper setup and configuration of 
  Ant and its dependencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. View Result</p>
<p>Go to the CALVARY_HOME/build directory and view the resulting HTML document. 
</p>
<p>7. Rinse, Lather, Repeat</p>
<p>This may require several steps until the HTML works correctly. When trouble 
  occurs, make a backup of the XSL and start simple, then add complexity as successes 
  occur. Hint: Use the browser refresh button after making changes and running 
  ant again. This will reduce the number of browser windows open. F5 or CTRL-R 
  are nice keyboard shortcuts for this.</p>
