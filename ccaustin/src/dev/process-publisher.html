<h3>Site Publisher</h3>
<p>The site publisher is responsible for moving the <a href="process-html.html">generated 
  html pages</a> from the <a href="process-builder.html">build process</a> to 
  the public web server. This is currently done automatically by a script that 
  runs at 2:30am each night (and several times on Sun and Wed for audio/tape updates), 
  but may involve a workflow process in the future to ensure that content is correct 
  before it becomes published.</p>
