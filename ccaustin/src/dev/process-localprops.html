<h3>local.properties</h3>
<p>This file is used to store the user id and password for the FTP server, and 
  other important information. There is an example.local.properties in <a href="process-cvs.html">CVS</a> 
  that may be copied and named local.properites, should the need to <a href="process-publisher.html">publish</a> 
  from a specific workstation or server be required. Storing ids and passwords 
  in this file enables our publish script to automatically perform important tasks 
  (publishing our<a href="process-html.html"> HTML </a>to the <a href="process-production.html">production</a> 
  web server) without actually storing ids and passwords in CVS that someone may 
  be able to break into in the future.</p>
