<h3>Ant Script</h3>
<p>What's an Ant script? Well, its a library from the Apache group (they make 
  web server software) which allows you to define the steps needed to build a 
  project. We use Ant, which requires<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/j2se"> 
  Java 1.3.1</a> or newer, to define how our web site gets built - from the XSL 
  transformations, date/version substitutions, staging deployment, and publishing 
  to production. An Ant script has one or more targets, which are commands that 
  tell the script to do things. We currently use the following targets:</p>
<h4>Web target</h4>
<p>The web target builds the entire web site by using the <a href="process-sitemap.html">sitemap.xml 
  </a>as a list of pages to build. This enables you to see the web site changes 
  you made on your local machine, or build the site from the latest code stored 
  in <a href="process-cvs.html">CVS source control</a>. </p>
<h4>Dist target</h4>
<p>The dist target copies the web site, all associated images, and supporting 
  files (stylesheets, javascript libraries, etc) to a specific directory. This 
  enables us to stage the site for our hourly builds (done automatically). </p>
<h4>Publish target</h4>
<p>The publish target takes a distribution and FTPs it to the production server, 
  using the id and password located in a <a href="process-localprops.html">local.properties</a> 
  file you create. This is done automatically, but also could be done manually 
  from our staging server in an emergency.</p>
