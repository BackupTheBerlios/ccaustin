Setup for the first time
========================

This is a one-time setup procedure to get yourself ready to edit xml files:

1. Install Cygwin (Unix tools for Windows - not needed for Unix systems) :
     a. http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/
     b. Install using the internet installer. It will download and
     install all appropriate things. I use c:\cygwin as the
     installation location.
2. Set the following environment variables:

     CVSROOT=:ext:<your id>@cvs.ccaustin.berlios.de:/cvsroot/ccaustin
     CVS_RSH=ssh

     Windows 95, 98, ME:
     
     1. click start
     2. click run
     3. type "sysedit" in the white box.
     4. click ok
     5. goto the AUTOEXEC.BAT window
     6. goto the bottom of the file (should be a blank line)
     7. type the following 2 lines EXACTLY AS THEY APPEAR
        Note: <your id> is the username (id) you created at the web site.

     set CVSROOT=:ext:<your id>@cvs.ccaustin.berlios.de:/cvsroot/ccaustin
     set CVS_RSH=ssh
     
     click file at the upper lefthand corner.
     click exit
     click yes to save 
     
     click start
     click shutdown
     click restart to restart your PC.
     click ok

     5. Click OK. 
     6. Reboot your machine to ensure that the settings took effect.

     Windows 2000/XP:

3. Start cygwin from the icon it created during installation.
4. type: cd //c

6. type: cd Projects
7. type: cvs co ccaustin
8. Enter your password for the site when prompted. (You may see a message with a yes/no prompt. Just type 'yes' and press enter. You won't see this message again).

The one-time setup is now complete!

Routine editing of pages
========================
1. Start cygwin from the icon it created during installation.
2. type: cd //c/Projects/ccaustin
3. type: cvs update -dP
4. Once all files have been updated, you can open the file you want to edit with your editor of choice. 

   For example, to edit the Sun/Wed messages, you would locate the xml
   file under c:\Projects\ccaustin\src\web\xml\msgs\msgs.xml and edit
   it with your favorite editor and save it when completed.

5. After editing the file, go back to the cygwin shell and type:
    cvs commit -m "<some message like: Edited messages for May 15, 2002 service" src/web/xml/msgs
6. Your changes are now in the source control server and will be
    reviewed and published by the web ministry team.
