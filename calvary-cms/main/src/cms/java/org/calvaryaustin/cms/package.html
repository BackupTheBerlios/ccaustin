<h1>Content Management System</h1>
<p>The CMS package provides the data model for how content
is stored and retrieved from the content repository. To get started, use the RepositoryFactory to
provide the appropriate information to obtain a reference to a <a
href="Repository.html">Repository</a> implementation, which may be either local or remote. A <a
href="Repository.html">Repository</a> contains <a href="Site.html">Site</a>s, which contains <a
href="Folder.html">Folder</a>s, which contains other <<a href="Folder.html">Folder</a>s and <a
href="File.html">File</a>s. The format of the Files in the Repository is opaque, and it is therefore
up to external application interfaces to define how the content is treated based on its content type
and the content itself. </p>
