    validation.xml defines the global validators that can be used for
    various form bean fields, and the "form sets" that assign validators
    to indiv. form bean fields.

    Note that fields can have page numbers and a page number can be passed
    from the web page as a hidden field to determine which fields of a
    form bean are validated during a single request. This enables portions
    of a form bean to be validated in a multi-step wizard approach.

    This file was based on the validation.xml in the examples found in the
    .zip archive at: http://home.earthlink.net/~dwinterfeldt/overview.html

        Form sets are groups of form definitions, which contain the
        named reference to the form bean and one or more fields and their
        validation rules.
