      <p>The Tape &amp; CD Ministry is a very important part of Calvary
      Chapel Austin.  Most of us are blessed to receive the Gospel by
      being able to learn and fellowship together at the church.  Some
      people, for many reasons, can't attend the church in person or
      they need to fill in weeks that they might have missed.  It also
      offers a way that we as believers can evangelize friends, family
      and strangers.  Not everyone is gifted to evangelize personally,
      but what better way than by handing them a cassette or CD from
      Calvary Austin!  We have many people who buy 5 or 10 tapes and
      give them out to anyone who will take one and listen to it.  So,
      with that being said, the purpose and mission of the tape
      ministry is to spread the message of the Gospel!</p> 
      <p>We Have tapes and CD's available for Sunday and Wednesday
      services.  You can purchase messages following these services or
      you can call the church office anytime to order a tape or CD
      (Office# 512-719-4667).  We also offer a <link href="../msgs/msgsTapeArchive.html">catalog</link> of messages
      that enables you to order any message you may have missed and
      the catalog can also be requested by calling the office.  We
      offer a subscription plan as well in which you can pay quarterly
      and receive tapes or CD's in the mail automatically.  If you
      have any questions about buying tapes or CD's, give us a call
      and we'll make sure that you get what you want! </p>
