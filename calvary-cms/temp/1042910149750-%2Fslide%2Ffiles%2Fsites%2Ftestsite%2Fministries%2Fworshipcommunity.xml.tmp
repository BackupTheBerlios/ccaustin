	  <overview>The Worship Community is a contemporary choir made up of men and women from the general body of Calvary Chapel of Austin.  This group of singers participates in selected Sunday services as well as special events. The purpose of the Worship Community is twofold: to present a unique alternative to the regular worship service, and to allow a wider group of people to use their gifts and talents to lead the body into worship.</overview>
