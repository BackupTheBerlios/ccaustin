	  <overview>Our Calvary Kids Ministry aim is to lovingly guide children into a close walk with Jesus.  We place a strong emphasis on Bible teaching and a desire for our children to know and serve God at an early age and be equipped to stand strong in their world.</overview>
	  <long-description>
	    <p>Calvary Kids is designed to minister to children from ages one month through 5th grade.  We have seven departments:  nursery, toddler, preschool, early elementary (K-1st), mid elementary (2nd-3rd), late elementary (4th-5th),and YDC (young disciple's club K-5th).  We love children and open our classes to serve them on all service times.  Our Sunday class activities includes Bible lessons, worship, crafts, play, felt stories, games and lots of heart felt care from trained teachers and assistants.</p>
		<p>On Wednesday evening we have a separate curriculum servicing our Toddler and Preschool Ministries.  Our YDC Club meets on Wednesday evening as well, and trains our children in a real fun, active way to live for Christ.  They win prizes and earn awards as they learn important Christian values and Biblical truths.</p>
